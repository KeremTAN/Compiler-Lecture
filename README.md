## <b> Aim of This Repository </b>
&nbsp; The aim of this repository is to keep the applications in the books which I've been studying on about the field of compilers while I trying to improve myself. Since this repository is related to the compilers area, the applications here will be made with the LLVM library.</br>

<b>[WARNING!]</b> Most of the information in this repository is a summary of what I have read and understood myself. The information here may not be completely accurate. For more detailed information on compilers, please study the <b>Dragon book and Kai Nacke's LLVM book</b>.

##  <b> Section 1 - Basics Of Compiler  </b>
&nbsp; In this section a very simple application is developed to understand the basic steps of a compiler. </br>
A compiler consists of 3 steps. </br>
These steps are Front-End, Optimizer and Back-End and these steps consist of sub-steps within themselves.
* Front-End
    * Scanning Analyzer
    * Syntactical Analyzer / Parser
    * Semantic Analyzer
* Optimizer
* Back-End
    * Instruction Selection
    * Instruction Scheduling
    * Register Allocation
